Microsoft strongly recommends converting your EXE installer to MSIX format for Microsoft Store submission. MSIX provides several benefits including free code signing.

## Benefits of MSIX Format:

1. **Free Code Signing**: Microsoft handles signing automatically
2. **Free Hosting**: No need for external hosting like Vercel
3. **Better Integration**: Native Windows Store integration
4. **Automatic Updates**: Built-in update mechanism
5. **Sandboxed Installation**: Enhanced security

- **Description**: Professional Excel file splitter desktop application

#### Step 5: Generate MSIX

3. Save the MSIX file for submission

### Method 2: electron-builder MSIX Target

We can try building MSIX directly using electron-builder:

```json
{
  "win": {
    "target": [
      {
        "target": "appx",
        "arch": ["x64"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Method 3: Manual MSIX Creation

1. Create AppxManifest.xml
2. Package using MakeAppx.exe
3. Sign using SignTool.exe

## Current Status Options:

### Option A: Try MSIX Build Again

- Fix the electron-builder MSIX build that was failing
- This would create a native MSIX package

### Option B: Use Microsoft's MSIX Packaging Tool

- Install the tool on Windows
- Convert your working EXE to MSIX
- Submit the MSIX instead of EXE

### Option C: Use Microsoft Trusted Signing

- Sign your existing EXE using Microsoft's signing service
- Keep current EXE format but with valid signature
